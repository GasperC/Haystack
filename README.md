Haystack SDK contains multiple extensions and enhancements for **iOS** developers, including a collection of simple Objective-C classes and categories that fit in almost every project. Most of these classes are not large or structured enough to fit in a special library or framework, but are regurarely needed throughout the most projects you are working on. Basically it is meant to fill the void of classes without entire libraries.

Project is actively developed and as the Apple SDK's changes, project is updated. Note that the project is not finished and might contain bugs. Feel free to open an issue. To avoid clashing with any future framework improvements, all Haystack categories and classes are prefixed with `Hay`.

Contents
========
Haystack is **not limited only** to Objective-C code, but contains multiple resources used in development. Resources are divided into sections, each of which is represented by a folder of the same name:

- **Pods**

   Example podfiles that are used in many of the commercial projects, including more advanced configurations and even podspec files to create new specifications.  
   
   
- **Scripts**

   Handful of bash and Ruby scripts that help with iOS development. Scripts include management of Xcode SDK's, copying them around, which is useful for Beta development.

- **SDK**

   Contains Objective-C classes and categories that are installed part of a CocoaPods install. The classes are general and extend base Apple SDK's. **SDK supports iOS 7 and up**.

Usage
=======

Documentation
-------
All header files and fully documented for ease of use. Only method stubs are displayed in readme, to keep it short. The documentation is in DoxyGen format, allowing Xcode to parse documentation headers or generate HTML docs.

Installation & Setup
--------
You can install the SDK via CocoaPods:
```ruby
pod 'Haystack'
```

Or manually drag & drop `Haystack` folder into Xcode project, then follow the **Using in project** section.

Using in project
--------
It is recommended for you to add Haystack.h file into precompiled header (.pch). That way all classes and categories are added to all files and you can use them everywhere throughout the project.

Documents
=======
Haystack SDK includes documents that can be used to improve development workflow.

- **Deployment workflow**
  - Automated testing
  - Continuous Integration
- **Coding guidelines**
- **Development tools**
